# Emotion-Recognition
Implementation of a deep neural network to solve the emotion recognition problem on the DEAP database (http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html)

Our first approach had the goal of predicting exactly the value of arousal, valence, liking and dominance.

The second approach intends to solve two 3-class classification problems to predict 9 emotion states:
  1. Valence: 
    1-3: negative
    4-6: neutral
    7-9: positive
  2. Arousal:
    1-3: passive
    4-6: neutral
    7-9: active
